# Thoughts...
Leave virtual comments on various rooms and locations around the world. The goal is to create an augmented reality of YikYak. It is extremely localized and will only show you the thoughts of the people who have been in your location. It will sort by showing the best thoughts first based on the user voting. Users can vote using a tinder styled 'like or pass' animation thanks to the [SwipeCards library](https://github.com/Diolor/Swipecards). Stay tuned for updates!
